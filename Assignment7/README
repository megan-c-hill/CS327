The code is now written in C++.

There were also two new features added. Those two features are fog of war and teleportation.

Fog of War means that the player only has a 5x5 visible radius. This can be toggled with the f key.

The player can now move via teleportation. To activate this feature the player presses t during their turn.
Once in the teleportation mode an asterisk will appear representing the player's new position.
The player can be moved with the same keys as they can when not teleporting, then press t to select that position.
When in teleportation mode the player can press r to be teleported to a random spot, but they may teleport into rock.
