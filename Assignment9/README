Updated Combat Schematics and Object handling

In my implementation objects related moves (equipping items, etc.) do not take a turn.

If an action can not be completed, because of the current state or invalid user input it is handled "gracefully" (takes you back to last screen),
but does not give any indication that happened.

If a player has an item with large amounts of damage equipped it may be cropped off when examining the character, but it only
said you had to show the description.

In the current implementation it is impossible to have negative speed, but my code would have undefined behavior if you
were to equip items such that your speed went under 0.

If you teleport onto a spot where a monster is it initiates a fight with that monster, and the player
reverts back to their previous spot.

NOTE:

You can specify the number of items with a switch, but that switches must be in this order

./dungeon --nummon # --numitems #

For colors, and object types only the first one is accounted for. In addition in my implementation Objects can not stack.
