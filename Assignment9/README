Loads monster description which we parsed in the previous assignment.

Loads in the basic characteristics. Once a monster with the trait UNIQ or
an artifact object has been placed in the dungeon once it can not be placed in the dungeon again.

Visible Effects: This adds colors to the dungeon, new symbols for monsters, as well as adding their names to the
monster description  list

You can specify the number of items with a switch, but that switches must be in this order

./dungeon --nummon # --numitems #

NOTE: For colors, and object types only the first one is accounted for. In addition in my implementation Objects can not stack.
